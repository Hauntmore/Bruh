## Bruh-Bot | Guild member join event variables.

The "welcome" command in the "configure" category supports four tag blocks.

1. {user.tag} - The output of this would be the user's tag (Hauntless#3212).
2. {user.mention} - This will translate the member into their mention (@Hauntless#3212).
3. {guild.name} - This would return the guild name (Hauntless's New Server).
4. {guild.memberCount} - This caches all the members in the guild and output it into a digit (15).
